# Testing Instructions

To be able to test the application, I'll leave two accounts already created below.
One of them is a pet owner account and the other is also a pet owner account and is also already approved as a pet sitter.
The account that has already been approved for pet sitter to change to pet sitter you have to go to profile -> switch to sitter
